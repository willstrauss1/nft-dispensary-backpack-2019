# Dispensary NFT Backpack (2019 Prototype)

> 🕒 Developed in **May 2019** — years before “dynamic NFTs” or “RWA NFTs” became industry buzzwords.  
> This prototype explored how **NFTs could evolve with real-world purchases** to create **gamified loyalty, terpene-based personalization, and marketing intelligence**.

Originally presented to **Verano Holdings**, one of the largest U.S. cannabis MSOs. Talks ended after a board shift, but the concept remains a pioneering example of retail × blockchain utility.
